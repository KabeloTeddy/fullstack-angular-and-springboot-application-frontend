Project Description:

Welcome to my E-Commerce Fullstack Application!

This repository hosts the first version (v1) of my e-commerce application, built using modern development tools and technologies. My goal is to create a robust and feature-rich platform for online shopping. While this initial version showcases the core functionality, I have exciting plans for future releases.

Key Features (v1):

Frontend: I developed the frontend with Angular and TypeScript, providing an intuitive and responsive user interface. Features include product browsing, a shopping cart, pagination, routing, and validation.

Backend: Powered by Spring Boot and MySQL, the backend offers RESTful APIs for product management, shopping cart operations, and order processing. It seamlessly integrates with the frontend to provide a seamless shopping experience.

Database: MySQL serves as my database, storing product data, customer information, and order details securely.

Checkout and Purchase: Customers can add products to their cart, provide shipping and billing details, and complete their purchase. A unique order tracking number is generated for each transaction.

Important Note:

Before running the application, please ensure that you've executed all the necessary SQL database scripts provided in the project. These scripts are essential for initializing the database and ensuring that the application functions correctly. Detailed instructions for running these scripts can be found in the project's documentation.

Prerequisites:

To run this project, you need to have the following tools installed:

Node.js: To execute JavaScript code and use npm, install Node.js from nodejs.org.

npm (Node Package Manager): npm comes bundled with Node.js. It's used for managing project dependencies.

Maven: For building and managing the Spring Boot backend, install Maven from maven.apache.org.

TypeScript Compiler (tsc): For compiling TypeScript code to JavaScript, install the TypeScript compiler globally using npm with the command: npm install -g typescript.

Upcoming Features (Future Versions):

I have ambitious plans for the future of this project, including:

Security: Implementing authentication and authorization using JWT, OAuth2, and OpenID Connect for user accounts. I'll also enhance security with SSL/TLS.

Payment Processing: Integrating Stripe for secure and seamless online payments.

User Management: Adding user registration, login, and logout functionality. Protecting access to sensitive data.

Enhanced UI/UX: Continuously improving the user interface and experience, making it even more user-friendly and responsive.

Testing and Documentation: Rigorous testing and comprehensive documentation to ensure reliability and ease of use.

Deployment: Setting up Docker and Kubernetes for simplified deployment and scaling.

Monitoring and Analytics: Implementing monitoring tools and analytics for performance tracking and user behavior analysis.

Compliance: Ensuring compliance with relevant regulations such as GDPR or CCPA.

I invite you to explore my codebase, contribute to my project, and stay tuned for exciting updates as I evolve this e-commerce application into a powerful and secure platform for online shopping.

NOTE: Ensure the backend is cloned and db scripts are successfully ran before cloning the frontend




This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
